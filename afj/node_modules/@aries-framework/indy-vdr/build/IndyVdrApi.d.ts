     * This method endorses a transaction. The transaction can be either a string or a JSON object.

     *
     * If the transaction is not signed, we have a special case where the endorser will author the transaction.
     * This is required when a new did is created, as the author and the endorser did must already exist on the ledger.
     * In this case, the author did (`identifier`) must be equal to the unqualified identifier of the `endorserDid`.

     * @param endorserDid the did of the endorser
     * @returns An endorsed transaction
