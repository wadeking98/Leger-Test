     * This method tries to find the verification method associated with the JWT credential or presentation.
     * This verification method can then be used to verify the credential or presentation signature.
     *
     * The following methods are used to extract the verification method:
     *  - verification method is resolved based on the `kid` in the protected header
     *    - either as absolute reference (e.g. `did:example:123#key-1`)
     *    - or as relative reference to the `iss` of the JWT (e.g. `iss` is `did:example:123` and `kid` is `#key-1`)
     *  - the did document is resolved based on the `iss` field, after which the verification method is extracted based on the `alg`
     *    used to sign the JWT and the specified `purpose`. Only a single verification method may be present, and in all other cases,
     *    an error is thrown.
     *
     * The signer (`iss`) of the JWT is verified against the `controller` of the verificationMethod resolved in the did
     * document. This means if the `iss` of a credential is `did:example:123` and the controller of the verificationMethod
     * is `did:example:456`, an error is thrown to prevent the JWT from successfully being verified.
     *
     * In addition the JWT must conform to one of the following rules:
     *   - MUST be a credential and have an `iss` field and MAY have an absolute or relative `kid`
     *   - MUST not be a credential AND ONE of the following:
     *      - have an `iss` field and MAY have an absolute or relative `kid`
     *      - does not have an `iss` field and MUST have an absolute `kid`
